# Quebec Teacher Hub v4 - NextUI v2 Setup Guide

```bash
npm uninstall @heroui/react

2. **Update your files with the provided code above:**
   - Replace `providers.tsx` with the NextUI version
   - Replace `QuebecTeacherHubInterface.tsx` with the NextUI version  
   - Update `globals.css` with the new theme-aware styles
   - Create/update `tailwind.config.js` with NextUI configuration

## 🎯 Expected Results

After implementing these changes, you should see:

3. **Smooth theme switching** - No flickering or layout shifts
4. **Better form UX** - Clear validation states and feedback

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If components don't render:
```bash
npm install @nextui-org/system @nextui-org/button @nextui-org/input
```

### If styles don't apply:
1. Ensure `tailwind.config.js` includes NextUI plugin
2. Restart your dev server after config changes
3. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`

### If theme switching doesn't work:
- Check that `suppressHydrationWarning` is in your HTML tag
- Ensure NextThemesProvider has `attribute="class"`

## 🚀 Next Steps

2. **Customize colors** - Adjust the Quebec theme colors in `tailwind.config.js`
3. **Add functionality** - Connect the form to your backend API
4. **Performance** - The setup is already optimized for Turbopack
